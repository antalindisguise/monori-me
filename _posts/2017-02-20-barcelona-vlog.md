description: In October 2016, @zsofihutai and me have visited the Catalan city of Barcelona for the first time! We made some videos here and there and I have put together some video montage to document our trip.

I'll be short -- I made some video montage back in January about our trip (first time!) to the Catalan city of Barcelona where we spent almost a week wondering around the streets filled with beautiful buildings, lively streets and lovely people.

We had so much good food, drinks, hikes and outdoor activities to fill our days, that even the moody, rainy weather could not break.

Most of you have probably seen it before, but I think it's worth an entry in my blog too.

Enjoy!

The purpose of this montage was really for me to learn more about video making and better prepare myself for my upcoming trip that I want to document much better. I am curious to know what do you personally think about these videos! More short cuts? Less image stabilization? Less music more talking? Less shakiness? Less walking and shooting? Please let reach out to me on any way possible. ðŸ™Œ
