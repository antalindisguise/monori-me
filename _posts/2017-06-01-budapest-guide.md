If you know me, you are most likely aware of my secret admiration towards this city - the capital of Hungary, Budapest. I have never lived there myself, but I have spent a tremendous amount of time there. During those times, I have got to experience many faces of this beautiful city and I have gathered my list of favorites that I am going to share with you down below. I tried to select lesser known places, but I could not leave out the popular tourist spots either. Each section represents a _track_ that might appeal to certain group of people, but they in no way are limited to them. Feel free to mix and match and let me know if something is outdated.
