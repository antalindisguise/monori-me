description: For the second time in a row, the Google Design team creates a gorgeous reader summarizing their yearly SPAN conference - conversations about design and technology - and they sent me one copy as well!

Google SPAN it is a relatively small-sized conference that revolves around the discussion between design and technology. It started in 2014 under the name of _FORM_, organized in San Francisco, CA. Starting 2015, they started organizing the yearly conference in two distinct locations around the world, aligning the theme to these cities and operating under a new name: SPAN. In 2015 it was London, UK and New York City, NY while in 2016 it was Tokyo, JP and Los Angeles, CA.

Google is well known for their goodie-bags that they usually give out at conferences in past (I/O), but they decided to do something different for this time:

> "So instead of more branded tees or tchotchkes, we decided to produce something that designers might actually want to keep"

I was lucky enough to be invited for their 2016 edition of the SPAN conference in London and therefore managed to get my hands on their [first edition](https://design.google.com/articles/first-edition/) of the SPAN reader.

This past year (2016), I was unable to attend their annual conference, but the Google Design team saved the day and as part of a limited giveaway: they have sent me a copy of the [second edition](https://design.google.com/articles/volume-two/) of their reader.

The amount of detail is just mind-blowing; starting with the binding of the pages, the typesetting and well-thought design on every single page is just immense. It is a book you want to hold in your hand.

So, thanks again for the copy, @GoogleDesign
