description: First time entering North America, and I somehow ended in it's best part! ⛰🌁🌇🦌🏞

First time in North America, Canada and Vancouver has been very welcoming. I spend 2 weeks in **Vancouver** area playing tourist and taking in the West Coast lifestyle that Vancouver is so proud about. The trip has taken place in **February 2016**, so I wasn't sure what weather to expect, but it was all good: sunny ☀️, rainy🌦, snowy 🌨 and full of life. I even had the chance to take some basic surf lessons and practice on the shores of the Pacific in [Tofino, Vancouver Island](#) (_coming soon_). Along the trip, I used my GoPro Hero+, iPhone 6S Plus and Canon D700 with 18-55mm IS STM lense. Hope you enjoy the pictures 🖼✨👋
