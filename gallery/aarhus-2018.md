After the turn of the year in **January 2018, Aarhus** has been blessed with near freezing temperatures and a lot of sunshine ☀️, therefore I took some time off to walk around and take some scenic pictures in and around the center, using my Nexus 6P camera 📱📷 and its super-awesome Google Photos HDR functionality. Hope you will like the below pictures 👋
