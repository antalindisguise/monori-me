Decided to take a quick **36 hour trip to Stavanger**, Norway with a good friend of mine using a deal we found online: take the Fjordline overnight ferry from Hristdahl, Denmark with a room, lock our stuff up there while disembarking the ferry that continued on to Bergen, Norway to return that same night while we took an excursion to Tau and the mighty Preikestolen, only to return to explore Stavanger and its quirks before catching up with the ferry and getting back to Denmark in a course of a 2 day trip. I brought my DSLR Canon D700 with 18-55mm IS STM lense with me to take some shots 📸.
