description: My first ever photoset with the shiny new camera I bought weeks back
---

Just weeks after I've got my shinyâœ¨ new DSLR camera ðŸ“¸, I decided to go out around the turn of the year, **December 2015** to take some shots of the beautiful city of **Budapest** ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º. While majority of these shots were done on the last day of 2015, some of them were taken in the first week of January 2016. The camera I purched was a Canon D700 with 18-55mm IS STM lense. I had no camera stand at that point, so I am quite proud of the results that can be seen below, also considering I only had the camera for less then a month at this point. Hope you enjoy the shots below ðŸ”»
