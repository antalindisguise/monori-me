One a very melancolic **2016 fall weekend** I took a big walk of around 15 kms out in the Danish countryside outside of **Esbjerg** with only my phone as a camera 📱📸 The pictures came out near perfect and been one of my favorites that I have ever shot - intense colours of the fall, sea and sky. Perfect weather conditions made it even better! From a technical point of view, no further modifications were done to any of these pictures besides using the HDR+ mode on my Nexus 6P running Android 7.0 at the time 🙌
