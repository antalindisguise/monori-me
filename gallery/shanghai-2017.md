Spent almost 2 weeks down in this megacity back in **March 2017**, exploring the culture, getting lost in it's concrete jungle and eating out. It was definitely an easy starter for someone who never visited China before, but it was just enough of culture shock to set the appetite for yet another adventure there! The images below are edited, but it does try to capture the magic of the city through the lense of my Nexus 6P (HDR+ enabled) and my DSLR Canon D700 with 18-55mm IS STM lense. Hope you enjoy watching them as much as I did capturing them ðŸ‘‹.
