On the same trip in March 2017 when I was in [Shanghai](/gallery/shanghai-2017), a short excursion to Hangzhou has left me speachless about the beautiful nature 🏞, citiscape 🏢 and people 👩🏻‍💼👨🏻‍🎓 of this magnicifienc booming city 🌆. So I ended up taking many photos on my Nexus 6P (HDR+ enabled) and my DSLR Canon D700 with 18-55mm IS STM lense. 

Truth to be told, I am bummed that I only spend so little time in this city, as I have felt it more welcoming and enjoyable than Shanghai, although both cities are fascinating to me. If you are in the area, definitely don't miss this place! Hope you enjoy them as much as I do. 👋
