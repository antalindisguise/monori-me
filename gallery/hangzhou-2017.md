On the same trip in **March 2017** when I was in [Shanghai](/gallery/shanghai-2017), a short excursion to **Hangzhou and the West Lakes** has left me speachless about the beautiful nature 🏞, citiscape 🏢 and people 👩🏻‍💼👨🏻‍🎓 of this magnicifienc city 🌆. I ended up taking many pictures on my Nexus 6P (HDR+ enabled) and my DSLR Canon D700 with 18-55mm IS STM lense. 

Truth to be told, I am bummed that I only spend so little time in this area, as I have felt it more welcoming and enjoyable than Shanghai was, even though both cities are fascinating to me for different reasons. If you are in the area, definitely don't miss out on this place! Hope you enjoy the 📸 them as much as I had taking them 👋
