A geek who navigates using zshell and git commit -am "all the time". I like open source software, to attend hackathons and I take pride in the code that I produce.

Currently working as a **Mobile App Developer for [The LEGO Group](https://lego.com)**, where I focus on creating creative experiences targeting kids through mobile devices. I wore many hats before at the company - from frontend-solutions, all the way to infrastructure development.

I'm constantly looking for new challenges and opportunities, so please feel free to reach out to me. Let it be a question regarding code, or any of the interests that I have - I would be open to start a discussion with You!

Reach out to me on social media and I would be happy to chat or have a call with you!
